# Spec — <slug>

<!-- instruction: one-line links to inputs used.
> **Glossary:** [CONTEXT](./CONTEXT.md) (if present)
> **Reference module / docs / channels used:** name the specific paths/queries read in step 5, or «None — only the interview + CONTEXT».
> **Discovery:** [discovery.md](./discovery.md) if the discovery gate fired; otherwise «Not triggered — <reason>».
Do not mention competitive-research or ideation scratch work here — those inform §1, they are not inputs to cite. -->

## 1. Context

<!-- instruction: 3–4 paragraphs.
¶1 What we're solving — the concrete problem from the interview, for whom (cite a user segment).
¶2 Why now — the trigger (incident, contract, deadline, strategic shift).
¶3 The committed approach — 1–2 sentences. For M+/L this is the recommendation from the ideation pass; for XS/S it's the obvious direction from the deep-dive.
¶4 (optional) Traceability context — reference-module patterns or quoted sources, AND the slot where critic `Override` resolutions emit «Decision override: <headline> — rationale: <reason>» bullets.
This section is WHAT + WHY, not HOW. Do NOT name a concrete datastore / broker / framework / library here — that belongs to design. -->

## 2. Goals

<!-- instruction: 2–3 measurable strategic outcomes as a bullet list. Each is a manifestation of the committed approach (§1 ¶3). No raw numbers here — numbers live in §7 KPIs. -->

## 3. Non-goals

<!-- instruction: 3–4 explicit non-goals, each one sentence + a reason. Keeps scope honest. -->

## 4. User stories

<!-- instruction: ≥5 user stories, no upper cap. Enough to cover every role in the CONTEXT glossary + every goal in §2. Format:

### US-NN: <3–6 word action title>
**As a** <role from CONTEXT glossary>
**I want** <action>
**So that** <observable benefit>

Roles ONLY from the glossary (no invented `user`/`admin`). Each US is covered by ≥1 AC in §5. -->

### US-01: <title>

**As a** <role>
**I want** <action>
**So that** <benefit>

## 5. Acceptance criteria

<!-- instruction: ≥1 AC of EACH of the 5 coverage types (authorization waivable only by its explicit, sourced N/A — see type 3 below), no upper cap. Format:

### AC-NN (US-XX) — <coverage type>
**Given** <business preconditions: actor role, state of their domain objects, prior events>
**When** <business action from the actor's perspective>
**Then** <observable business outcome: actor sees X / system blocks Y and explains Z / system records W>

AC = business-observable outcome from the actor's perspective. NOT how the system does it.

FORBIDDEN in AC text (zero tolerance — critic F6 + pre-write regex):
- HTTP verbs (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
- URL paths (/things, /things/{id}, /api/v1/...)
- status-code numerics in the body (200/201/400/401/403/404/409/5xx)
- error-code strings matching `[a-z_]+\.[a-z_]+` (e.g. order.not_owner)
- JSON fragments / payload bodies ({field: "value"})
- SQL / DB constructs (UNIQUE, FK, raw INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE, constraint names)
The technical mapping for these lives in `api` + `decide-adr`. Here: only what the actor observes.

Allowed: glossary roles, domain-invariant NAMES as natural-language phrases («no published lessons», «unique sequence per course»), glossary domain objects.

The 5 mandatory coverage types (≥1 each):
1. happy — actor does the main flow → system records the outcome and confirms.
2. error — actor submits invalid input → system blocks it and explains the reason in plain language.
3. authorization — actor lacks permission → system denies access OR hides existence (rationale in business terms). The ONLY waiver: an explicit `**Authorization: N/A — <reason> (source: <upstream artifact + §ref>)` line, legal only when an authoritative upstream artifact (committed approach / §3 non-goal / discovery / named product doc) excludes auth or establishes a trust boundary — see draft-generation.md. Mirror the boundary in §3 + §6.1. A bare omission is a floor violation.
4. domain invariant — actor violates a named invariant → system blocks and names the invariant plainly.
5. cross-context — actor's action depends on state in another bounded context → system enforces the cross-context rule.

Tag each AC with its US-NN. Concurrent edge → add as AC-NNb, still in business language. -->

### AC-01 (US-01) — happy path

**Given** an authorized <role> owns a draft <domain-object>
**When** the <role> attempts to publish the <domain-object>
**Then** the system records it as published and confirms to the <role>

### AC-02 (US-01) — domain invariant violation

**Given** an authorized <role> owns a draft <domain-object> with no child <sub-objects>
**When** the <role> attempts to publish it
**Then** the system blocks the publication and tells the <role> that at least one <sub-object> is required first

## 6. Non-functional requirements

<!-- instruction: table, recommended floor (not a cap). Targets are NUMERIC (≤250ms, ≥30 req/s, 99.9%) — no adjectives («fast», «high»). Measurement = a concrete production metric. Unknown number → TBD with owner+due in §8, never «fast».
Waiver: when the scenario type makes an aspect meaningless (e.g. latency on a walking skeleton), the aspect may instead carry a sourced `**Measurement: N/A — <reason> (source: <artifact + §ref>)` line + a §8 revisit — aspect-scoped, never a silent whole-table drop (see draft-generation.md). -->

| Aspect | Target | Measurement |
|---|---|---|
| Latency p95 <write operation> | ≤ <N ms> | <metric source> |
| Latency p95 <read/list operation> | ≤ <N ms> | <metric source> |
| Throughput | ≥ <N req/s> per instance | smoke test in CI |
| Availability | 99.X% | monthly SLO window |
| <Concurrency / Accuracy> | <safety guarantee> | <how enforced> |

## 6.1 Security / privacy

<!-- instruction:
- Data classification: public / internal / confidential / regulated (one word + 1-sentence rationale).
- Personal data touched: none, OR list new fields with type + sensitivity.
- AuthZ/AuthN impact: which capabilities / permission checks are added, which checks run (e.g. «repo always filters by the caller's org»). Stay surface-neutral — no endpoint/route language here; `design` derives the surfaces and `api` the endpoints.
- Abuse cases (3–5): cross-tenant access, draft/data leak, injection through URL/text fields, spam-create with a rate limit, optional token misuse — each with the business response (deny vs hide-existence; rationale, not status codes).
- Security review verdict: Required (M+ / new authz boundary / new PII) or N/A with a concrete reason. -->

- **Data classification:** <...>
- **Personal data touched:** <...>
- **AuthZ/AuthN impact:** <...>
- **Abuse cases:**
  - <cross-tenant>: <business response>
  - <data-leak>: <how hidden>
  - <spam>: rate limit <N per minute per user>
- **Security review:** <Required / N/A with reason>

## 7. Metrics / KPIs

<!-- instruction: ≥3 important product-outcome KPIs, no upper cap. Every row fills all columns. baseline=0 is valid only when the current baseline is genuinely zero. An unknown or future-measured baseline is allowed only when Source/event explains how it will be established and §8 carries the owner+due. Decision threshold = the condition, evaluated after the timebox, that triggers ship / continue / iterate / rollback / stop / investigate.
Waiver: only when the scenario type (e.g. walking skeleton, throwaway spike) makes outcome measurement not yet meaningful AND an upstream source (§1 ¶3 / §3 / discovery / interview) says so, §7 may instead be a sourced `**Measurement: N/A — <reason> (source: <artifact + §ref>)` line + a §8 revisit OQ with owner + due. Never placeholder or vanity rows; never a silent empty table (see draft-generation.md). -->

| Metric | Why it matters | Source/event | Baseline | Target/timebox | Decision threshold | Owner | When reviewed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <metric 1> | <decision or success claim this proves> | <analytics event / log / support tag / survey> | <current value or baseline plan> | <target within N days> | <condition and resulting decision> | <role> | <date or cadence> |
| <metric 2> | <...> | <...> | <...> | <...> | <...> | <...> | <...> |
| <metric 3> | <...> | <...> | <...> | <...> | <...> | <...> | <...> |

## 8. Open questions

<!-- instruction: 2–4 open questions. Format: `- [ ] <question>? Default now: <X>. — owner: <name/role>, due: <date or stage trigger like "before sdd:tasks">`. Every question has an owner + due — a lone «TBD» is an anti-pattern. -->

- [ ] <question>? Default now: <...>. — owner: <name/role>, due: <date or stage>
- [ ] <question>? — owner: <name/role>, due: <date or stage>
