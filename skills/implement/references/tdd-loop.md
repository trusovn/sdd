# TDD loop — the per-task cycle (step 8)

Every task runs `SELECT → RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → GATE → COMMIT`. This is the same cycle whether the runner is the sequential agent, a team `implementer`, or a Workflow stage. The RED step is the load-bearing one — skip its discipline and the whole method collapses into "write code, write a test that happens to pass".

## SELECT

Pick the next task whose `deps` are all `done`. In sequential mode that's the topo order; in parallel modes the orchestrator hands it out. **Read the task file first** — `tasks.json`'s `file` field, `docs/features/<slug>/tasks/<task-slug>.md`: it carries the §5 acceptance criteria verbatim, the data delta, the API slice and the edge cases, each signed with its source. `spec.md §5` and the relevant `test-plan.md` AC rows are fallback context when a slice is insufficient, ambiguous, or contradicted by the code ([`./inputs.md`](./inputs.md)). Open `test-plan.md` linkage rows assigned to this task regardless: they are additional closure obligations, not reconstructed task context. Know before writing whether each assigned row needs a RED test, gate/release evidence, or explicit carry-forward because its outcome is post-release.

## RED — write the failing test first

1. Write the test(s) for this task's `acs` **before any production code**. Put them where the repo keeps tests for that layer (detected, not assumed).
2. Run the unit command. Capture the output.
3. **Classify the first run** — this is mandatory and must be stated aloud:

   | Class | What it looks like | Action |
   |---|---|---|
   | **GOOD red** | test compiles, runs, fails on an assertion or «not implemented» | proceed to GREEN |
   | **BAD red** | the test itself won't compile / import-errors / references a symbol that the test got wrong | the test is broken, not the code — **fix the test**, re-run, re-classify |
   | **false-pass** | green on the very first run, before any production code | the test is too weak (asserts nothing real) — **strengthen it** until it's GOOD red |
   | **NON-red** | skipped because its dependency is unavailable (e.g. Docker absent for an integration test) | not a pass and not a fail — record NON-red, governed by `require_integration` |

4. **Quote the failing line** (the assertion + expected-vs-actual, or the «undefined: X» line) before writing any production code. This is the proof that the test exercises the right thing.

A task with only a NON-red integration test and no unit coverage cannot be driven by TDD locally — write the unit-level RED too, and let the integration RED land in CI (the proving-run pattern).

## GREEN — minimal code to pass

Write the **least** code that turns the quoted failing assertion green. No speculative generality, no unrelated edits, nothing outside the task's `files_hint`. Re-run the unit command; confirm the previously-quoted failure is now green and nothing else broke.

## REFACTOR — clean while staying green

Tidy names, extract helpers, remove duplication — re-running the unit command after each change. If a refactor goes red and isn't trivially fixable, **revert it**; the task's job is the GREEN, not the cleanup.

## GATE — the task isn't done until this is clean

Run, per the detected commands + settings:

- **unit** — must be green.
- **integration** — green if available; NON-red recorded if Docker is absent under `require_integration: auto`; BLOCK was already enforced for `always`.
- **lint** (if `gate_lint` and a linter resolved) — clean.
- **vet/typecheck** (if `gate_vet` and a command resolved) — clean.

Any hard-gate failure (unit red, or integration red when it ran, or lint/vet errors) → the task is not done. Fix, or escalate (see [`escalation.md`](./escalation.md)).

## COMMIT — task-scoped, traceable

When `auto_commit: per_task`, commit only this task's files with a message like:

```
<type>(<slug>): <task title>

<one-line what + why>

SDD-Task: T3
SDD-AC: AC-02
SDD-AC: AC-04
SDD-Check: RISK-01
SDD-Check: MEAS-01
```

One `SDD-AC` trailer per AC the task satisfied; one `SDD-Check` trailer per executable risk/measurement row closed by the task; the `SDD-Task` trailer ties the commit to `tasks.json`. Record the evidence in the task handoff. Then mark the task `done` in `tracker.md`. (`per_phase` batches a phase's tasks into one commit; `off` leaves committing to the user but still updates the tracker.)

**Compile-coupled lane exception.** Tasks in one compile-coupled lane (a shared-contract change + its implementer(s), marked by `tasks` via the shared contract file in `files_hint`) cannot each be committed green alone — the contract change breaks every implementer at compile time. They run **one shared GATE and one commit**: the commit carries an `SDD-Task` trailer **per task** and all of their `SDD-AC` trailers together, and the body names the coupling (e.g. «compile-coupled: T3 interface change + T4 implementation»). This is a sanctioned exception to task-scoped commits, not a license to batch unrelated tasks.

In parallel modes the **lead serializes commits in dependency order** even though the work happened concurrently — the history stays linear and bisectable.
